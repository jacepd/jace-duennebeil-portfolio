                <p>Hello! I’m Jace Duennebeil, a dedicated and driven computer science graduate from the University of Utah with a passion for problem-solving, software development, and continuous self-improvement. My journey is defined by a relentless work ethic, a love for learning, and a balanced, healthy lifestyle.</p>
                
                <p>With a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I have built a strong technical foundation in key areas like algorithms, data structures, mobile app development, and database management. My technical toolkit includes proficiency in C#, C++, Java, Python, Kotlin, SQL, R, and web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m also adept at using development tools like Git, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Eclipse, and Linux.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond coding, I’m a natural leader and team player. As captain of the University of Utah’s Ultimate Frisbee Club Team, I led strategy development, organized events, and fostered a culture of teamwork. I’m also a professional athlete with the Salt Lake Shred, where I’ve honed my adaptability, discipline, and perseverance on and off the field.</p>
                
                <p>Professionally, I’ve gained valuable experience in customer support and project management. At Microsoft, I served as a Customer Support Specialist, where I enhanced operational efficiency by developing PowerShell scripts and helped IT leaders implement company-wide Microsoft applications. My role as a Service Assistant at Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse sharpened my communication, training, and leadership skills in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment. Additionally, managing over countless successful lawncare projects with Riverview Lawn Care taught me how to independently balance customer satisfaction, scheduling, and quality control.</p>
                
                <p>My personal life reflects the same discipline and commitment. I prioritize health and wellness by maintaining a daily routine of gym workouts, physical activities, and balanced nutrition. This lifestyle fuels my mental clarity and energy, allowing me to excel in both my personal and professional endeavors.</p>
                
                <p>Whether it's developing user-centric software, leading a team to victory, or achieving personal health goals, I approach every challenge with determination and a growth mindset. I’m constantly seeking opportunities to apply my skills, learn new technologies, and make a positive impact. Let's connect and build something amazing together!</p>
